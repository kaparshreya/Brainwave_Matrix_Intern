ATM Interface
ATM Interface An ATM interface project in Python simulates the functionalities of an automated teller machine (ATM). 
It typically involves features such as user authentication (via PIN or password), checking account balance, withdrawing and depositing money, transferring funds, and generating mini-statements. 
The program usually operates through a simple text-based interface where users can interact with the system by entering commands.
It demonstrates the use of functions, loops, conditionals, and file handling to simulate real-world banking operations. 
The project can be expanded by incorporating database management systems for user data storage and retrieval.
